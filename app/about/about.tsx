                  Gautam & Ravi didn&apos;t plan to start Strengthâ€”it kind of tackled them first.
                  One rooftop football match, a lot of passes, and a debate about sports
                  and connection led to an idea: why isn&apos;t there a single place for every
                  sports enthusiast to connect, compete, and celebrate? And just like
                  that, Strength was born.

                  Whether you&apos;re an athlete, a fan, or someone who just loves debating
                  Ronaldo vs. Messi, Strength is your all-in-one sports haven. It&apos;s where
                  pickup games meet global tournaments, stats meet stories, and
                  everyone gets a chance to showcase their passion. Join us in rewriting
                  the playbook for sports communities, one goal (or airball) at a time.
